# An exercise from Paul Lockhart's [Arithmetic](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arithmetic-Paul-Lockhart/dp/0674972236)

The main goal of the code is to implement arithmetic in a way which neither takes (or coerces into) numberic types as parameters, nor returns (or presents) numeric types  as output. The core idea is that the concept of numbers of quantity does not depend on the literal numeric words and symbols (e.g. 3, one-hundred).
